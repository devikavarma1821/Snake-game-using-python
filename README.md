# Snake-game-using-python
This repository contains a simple Snake game implemented using Python's Tkinter library. The game allows players to control a snake, guiding it to eat food while avoiding collisions with the walls and its own body.
# Features
* Snake Movement: The player can control the snake's movement using arrow keys (up, down, left, right).
* Scoring: Each time the snake eats food, the player's score increases.
* Collision Detection: The game detects collisions between the snake and the walls or its own body, leading to game over.
* Game Over Screen: When the game is over, a "GAME OVER" message is displayed on the screen.
* Responsive Design: The game window is resizable and adjusts to the screen size.

#  Controls
